# How to Create and Publish a Git Branch

This guide demonstrates how to create and publish a new Git branch called `accelerate-with-copilot`.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Create the Branch Locally
```bash
git checkout -b accelerate-with-copilot
```

This command creates a new branch called `accelerate-with-copilot` and switches to it.

### 2. Verify the Branch Was Created
```bash
git branch
```

Expected output should show:
```
* accelerate-with-copilot
  copilot/create-and-publish-accelerate-with-copilot
```

### 3. Add Initial Content (Optional)
Create a README or marker file to document the branch purpose:
```bash
echo "# Accelerate with Copilot Branch" > BRANCH_README.md
git add BRANCH_README.md
git commit -m "Initialize accelerate-with-copilot branch"
```

### 4. Publish the Branch to Remote
```bash
git push -u origin accelerate-with-copilot
```

The `-u` flag sets up tracking between your local branch and the remote branch.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

You can also use the GitHub CLI to create and push branches:

```bash
gh repo clone <owner>/<repository>
cd <repository>
git checkout -b accelerate-with-copilot
git push -u origin accelerate-with-copilot
```

## Verification

To verify the branch exists remotely:

```bash
# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Or use GitHub CLI (replace with your repository details)
gh repo view <owner>/<repository> --web
```

## Branch Information

- **Branch Name**: `accelerate-with-copilot`
- **Purpose**: Accelerate development with GitHub Copilot features
- **Base Commit**: 77fbcc4 (Start exercise)
- **Created**: 2025-10-24

## Status

✅ Branch created locally
⏳ Branch publishing pending (requires authentication credentials)

The branch has been successfully created in the local repository. To publish it to the remote repository, execute:

```bash
git push -u origin accelerate-with-copilot
```

## Next Steps

Once the branch is published, you can:
1. Start developing new features
2. Create pull requests
3. Collaborate with team members
4. Use GitHub Copilot to accelerate your development workflow
